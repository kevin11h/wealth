I'm that multi-millionaire app developer who explained what it's like being rich. AMA.
Hi, I'm Allen Wong. I was told to create an AMA here after my comment about what it's like being rich shot to the top of the BestOf subreddit.
My upbringing: My parents were raised in the slums. My mother worked in a sweatshop in NYC. And my father passed away unnaturally three months after I graduated from college.
How I got started: After my father's passing, my mother suffered from a five-year-long psychotic episode. So I moved back to NYC from LA to take care of her. Since I was the only one in the family with a job due to the recession, I self-taught myself how to create apps during weekends and weeknights in hopes of making some side income. What I didn't expect was that this hobby ended up making much more than my full time job.
How the business is going: A few of my apps have topped the charts. Most recently, my Remote S for Tesla app became the #1 Lifestyle app and about 10-20% of Tesla owners have it. My most successful app, "5-0 Radio Police Scanner", is currently the #1 News app and has been and still is one of top downloaded apps since its creation in 2009. My second most successful app, Police Scanner+, was an app I created just to compete against myself so that I could hog up all the top search results for the keywords "Police Scanner" in the App Store.
What I do these days: Mostly traveling the world, dating, having fun with friends, and finding ways to help out the community. I have funded other people's kids' college funds, given people rides in my Lamborghini for charity, tipped people much more than what I was paying for, custom built an Iron Man suit to cheer up kids at hospitals, helped get clean water to villages that before didn't have access to it, and etc.
My gift to Redditors: I made one of my paid apps free for this AMA.
Advice on app development: Since I often get asked for advice, I gave speeches at different universities about how to get started on apps or how to make apps successful:
Speech 1 given at Valencia
Q&A for Speech 1 (starts at 45:54)
Speech 2 given at Harvard
My Proof: My Facebook
I will attempt to answer as many questions as possible no matter how ridiculous or random. Let's have some fun! AMA!
Final Edit: Thanks for doing the AMA with me! I had a lot fun. For those interested in learning more about my work ethic and marketing strategies, my book, Lifehacked, is available on Amazon, or eBook format with a discount for Redditors. Here are links to my first AMA from 2013, second AMA from 2015, and third AMA from 2017.
